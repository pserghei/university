# Aktuelle Technologien

Project created for the University Module Aktuelle Technologien im Bereich digitaler Medien. 

The intent was to create a design and prototype in Figma and turn it into a fully functional web application with Svelte.

The project is a simple web application that allows people to order their food online, book a table, or both. Because of the lack of time there is no interaction with a backend or external services.
